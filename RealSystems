💡 How to Use This List
Don’t just watch.
1. Pause the video.
2. Draw the architecture yourself.
3. Identify bottlenecks.
4. Suggest improvements.

That’s how you actually improve at system design.

System design isn’t about knowing buzzwords.
It’s about understanding trade-offs.

If you go deep into even 6–7 of these systems, you’ll be ahead of 90% of candidates walking into interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta.

If this helps, save it for later — this is easily 2–3 months of structured learning. 🔥
