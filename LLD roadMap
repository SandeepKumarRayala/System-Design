Phase 1: OOP Foundations 
Must-know concepts
Encapsulation (private state, public behavior)


Abstraction vs Interface


Inheritance (when NOT to use it)


Polymorphism (runtime > compile-time)


UML Diagrams
Interview expectations
Correct class responsibility


Proper access modifiers


Clean constructors
Practice mini-designs
Design a Printer


Design a BankAccount


Design a Car with Engine abstraction
 
Phase 2: SOLID Principles 
This is non-negotiable for SDE-2.
SRP – Single Responsibility
One class = one reason to change
OCP – Open Closed
Open for extension, closed for modification
LSP – Liskov Substitution
Child should be replaceable by parent
ISP – Interface Segregation
Many small interfaces > one fat interface
DIP – Dependency Inversion
Depend on abstractions, not concretes
Always explain what problem each principle solves.
Phase 3: Design Patterns (Week 3–4)
Focus on when & why, not memorization.
Creational
Singleton (thread-safe)


Factory


Abstract Factory


Builder


 Structural
Adapter


Decorator


Facade


Composite 


Behavioral (Very important)
Strategy ⭐⭐⭐


Observer ⭐⭐⭐


Command


State


Chain of Responsibility

 Most LLD problems reduce to Strategy + Factory + Composition


Phase 4: Concurrency in LLD 
SDE-2 often includes thread-safety discussion.
Must-know
synchronized


volatile


Lock, ReentrantLock


Executors


Thread-safe Singleton


Producer-Consumer


Apply in designs
Thread-safe Cache


Rate Limiter


Parking Lot entry system
Phase 5: Core LLD Interview Problems 
These are absolute must-designs
Beginner

Design a Vending Machine



Intermediate (SDE-2 Sweet Spot)

Parking Lot System


Elevator (Lift) System


LRU Cache

Ride Booking System (Uber/Ola)


URL Shortener


Logger System


Vending Machine


Online Shopping Cart


Hotel Booking System


Snake and Ladder Game


Library Management System


Task Scheduler


Cache with Expiry (TTL Cache)
